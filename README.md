The mini-project titled “Disaster Relief Resource Allocation System” aims to simulate and manage the process of providing aid to victims during natural disasters or emergency situations. It maintains a network of relief centres, each equipped with resources such as food, water, and medical supplies, and processes victim requests based on urgency and severity.

The system integrates multiple data structures to ensure efficient resource allocation. It helps automate the selection of the most suitable relief centre for each victim request by considering both priority of need and shortest network distance, creating a simplified model of real-world disaster logistics management.

-> Problem Definition:
During disasters such as floods, earthquakes, or storms, coordinating relief operations becomes extremely challenging.
Manually identifying which relief centre can serve which victim based on resource availability, location, and urgency leads to delays and inefficient resource utilization.
Hence, there is a need for a system that can:
•	Maintain information about relief centre and their available resources.
•	Register incoming victim requests with priority levels and required resources.
•	Automatically find and dispatch resources from the nearest eligible centre.
This project addresses the problem of optimizing disaster response coordination using efficient data structures and algorithms.
